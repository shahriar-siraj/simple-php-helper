# Exercise 03

## TDD helpers

Make some or all of the unit tests pass.

You can run one test at a time by "filtering" on either class or method name:

```
php vendor/bin/phpunit --filter className
php vendor/bin/phpunit --filter test_this_is_a_test_method
```

### Requirements

* Choose any tests, the more the better.
* Don't use any existing PHP frameworks or packages.
